# Satellite-Position-Forecasting

## About:
The increase in the number of RSOs (Resident Space Objects) indirectly increases the risk of collision of LEO Satellites.

The important point to be addressed here is the reliable and accurate orbit tracking of satellites to prevent a catastrophic event like the Kessler Syndrome.

This project is an experiment on predicting and forecasting the position of a satellite orbiting earth using Deep Learning (LSTM).

The LSTM model is trained on the data recorded over 18days and forecasts the trajectory for the next seven days.
